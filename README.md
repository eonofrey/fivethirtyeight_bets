# FiveThirtyEight vs. Vegas Odds 

David Harris came up with the idea of comparing fivethirtyeight.com's MLB predictions vs. the Vegas odds for betting. It works as follows: 


There are Vegas money lines for every MLB game of the season (below). For these games you'll see a number like +120, or -150 etc... These numbers are all based around $100 bets. A positive number, like + 120, means if you bet $100 on your team and they win, it will pay $120.
