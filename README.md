# FiveThirtyEight vs. Vegas Odds 

David Harris came up with the idea of comparing fivethirtyeight.com's MLB predictions vs. the Vegas odds for betting. It works as follows: 


There are Vegas money lines for every MLB game of the season (below). For these games you'll see a number like +120, or -150 etc... These numbers are all based around $100 bets. A positive number, like + 120, means if you bet $100 on your team and they win, it will pay $120. For a negative money line, ex. 150, you need to bet $150 to win $100. Teams with negative money lines are the favorites, since you get a smaller payout if they win. 

You can back into an implied probability of winning with these money lines. For example, a money line of +100 means you bet 100 to win 100, so the probability of that team winning is 50%.

On Nate Silver's website, fivethirtyeight.com, they post every MLB game of the season along with a "Chances of Winning" column (below)
